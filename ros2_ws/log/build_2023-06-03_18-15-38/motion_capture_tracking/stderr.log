[33mCMake Warning (dev) at /home/tdeng23/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/cmake/data/share/cmake-3.26/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (I2CDEV)
  does not match the name of the calling package (libi2c-dev).  This can lead
  to problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
